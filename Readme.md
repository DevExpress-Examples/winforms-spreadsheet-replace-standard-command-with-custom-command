# Spreadsheet for WinForms - Replace Standard SpreadsheetControl Commands with Custom Commands

This example illustrates the technique used to modify the functionality of existingÂ SpreadsheetControlÂ commands.

## Implementation Details

TheÂ SpreadsheetControlÂ exposes theÂ [ISpreadsheetCommandFactoryService](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.XtraSpreadsheet.Services.ISpreadsheetCommandFactoryService) interface that enables you to substitute the default command with your own custom command.

1. Create a custom command class, inherited from the command that youÂ wishÂ to replace. Override the required methods of the command.

2. Create a class inherited from theÂ [SpreadsheetCommandFactoryServiceWrapper](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.XtraSpreadsheet.Services.SpreadsheetCommandFactoryServiceWrapper), intended to substitute a default command service. In this class, override the [CreateCommand](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.XtraSpreadsheet.Services.SpreadsheetCommandFactoryServiceWrapper.CreateCommand(DevExpress.XtraSpreadsheet.Commands.SpreadsheetCommandId)) method to create an instance of a custom command class, an identifier of the currently processed command is passed as a parameter of this method.

3. Use theÂ `SpreadsheetCommandFactoryServiceWrapper` class descendant to substitute the default command service.
